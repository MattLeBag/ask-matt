# Frequently Asked Questions — Matt Bagley

---

## What kind of work do you do?
I build and scale brands, products, and creative systems that connect emotionally and perform commercially.  
My background crosses SaaS, fintech, health tech, and ed tech — from startups like Waave’s *Pay by Bank* to global platforms like *Virgin Pulse*.  
I combine brand strategy, UX/UI design, and creative leadership to help teams design with purpose and clarity.

---

## What are you working on right now?
I’m currently building *Smart Wiggle* — an AI-powered learning companion for neurodiverse children.  
It started as a project for my son and has grown into an inclusive design platform blending AI, education, and emotional intelligence.

---

## What’s your design philosophy?
Design should feel human.  
It’s not just about pixels or polish — it’s about empathy, clarity, and craft.  
Every product or campaign should solve a real problem and make people feel something genuine.

---

## How do you describe your leadership style?
Empathetic and collaborative.  
I like to create an environment where designers feel confident to experiment, fail fast, and grow.  
My role is to remove friction, build clarity, and connect creative work to business outcomes.

---

## What makes your work different?
I focus equally on **story** and **system**.  
That means every brand or interface has emotional storytelling backed by solid design architecture — consistency, scalability, and measurable impact.

---

## What’s a project you’re proud of?
Launching *Pay by Bank* (Waave).  
It started as push against the outdated payment system and became one of Australia’s first open-banking payment brands.  
Seeing people use a product you helped design from zero is deeply rewarding.

---

## How did your work at Virgin Pulse shape you?
It taught me scale and empathy.  
Leading global creative for 190+ countries required cultural sensitivity, cross-functional alignment, and constant communication.  
It also reinforced my belief that great design starts with shared purpose.

---

## How did Smart Wiggle begin?
Out of a real-life need.  
My son’s neurodivergent learning experience made me realise how rigid traditional education can be.  
So I began designing a learning companion that helps kids feel calm, confident, and curious — not pressured.

---

## How do you use AI in your workflow?
I use AI as a creative partner — not a shortcut.  
It helps me brainstorm faster, prototype smarter, and test ideas earlier.  
At Waave, I used tools like GPT, Midjourney, and Runway to accelerate content creation without losing brand quality.

---

## What kind of teams do you thrive in?
Cross-functional teams where product, marketing, and brand collaborate early.  
I enjoy translating strategy into something visual, human, and actionable that everyone can rally around.

---

## What’s your process for building a brand from scratch?
Start with **why**, not **what**.  
Define the emotion and purpose first, then build the visual and verbal system around it.  
From there, align design with product experience, so every touchpoint feels part of one story.

---

## What’s your approach to feedback and iteration?
Clear, kind, and fast.  
Good feedback focuses on the problem, not the person.  
I encourage regular critique loops so design decisions stay objective and connected to the bigger picture.

---

## How do you balance creativity and business needs?
By setting shared goals early.  
Creativity thrives within clear boundaries.  
If we know what success looks like — engagement, revenue, awareness, or behaviour change — we can design with freedom *and* focus.

---

## What inspires you outside of work?
The ocean.  
Photography, diving, and conservation projects keep me grounded.  
It’s where I reset and find perspective for my creative work.

---

## What’s next for you?
Continuing to blend creativity with emerging tech — AI, voice, AR — to build experiences that feel alive, personal, and purposeful.  
I’m also exploring how design leadership can empower teams to think beyond aesthetics and toward human outcomes.
